        <h2>What is Reproductive Justice?</h2>
        <p>Indigenous women, women of color, and trans people have always fought for it, but the term “Reproductive Justice” was coined in 1994 by a group of Black women convening in Chicago who called themselves “Women of African Descent for Reproductive Justice.”  According to SisterSong, Reproductive Justice is <u>“the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities.” </u>
        </p>
        <h2>Where does abortion access fit in to Reproductive Justice?</h2>
        <p>Abortion access is one part of the web of reproductive decision-making, and sits within the interlocking fights for racial, economic, gender, disability and climate justice. It’s also important to note that legal abortion does not equal abortion access.
          Historically, abortion rights campaigns utilizing the legal “choice” framework rather than a reproductive justice framework have failed to: center communities most impacted by oppression, address material & social conditions of those communities, and incorporate essential nuances informed by those communities into their fight for abortion - such as the violent history of eugenics, forced sterilization,  and medical racism inflicted upon Black people, disabled people, and poor and working class people of color.</u>
        </p>
        <h2>What is the history of Abortion Access in the United States? 
        </h2>
        <p>The history of abortion is long, tracing back to ancient times.  Over time, abortion and access to it have become increasingly shaped by technological advancements and permutations in systems of law. This connects reproductive inequity to larger historical growth in the carceral capacities of the state and the criminalization of poverty, race, and other vectors of marginalized identity. Below, we offer a brief visual timeline of some major moments in American abortion history. This is by no means an exhaustive summary; furthermore, this does not adequately capture the ongoing instances of violent backlash against abortion access throughout time.</p>

                <li>Prioritize state & local organizations, including networks of state & local organizations</li>
                <li>If possible, avoid anonymous funding in order to support the destigmitization of abortion and funding abortion access</li>
                <li>In additiion to funding the essential work of abortion funds, be sure to fund other Reproductive Justice organizations (some others are listed below)</li>
